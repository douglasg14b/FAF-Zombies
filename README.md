# FAF Zombies

Zombies mod for Forged Alliance Forver!

## What is this?

An updated version of the old Zombies mod created by Zarechaun. 

## What's Different?

* Lobby Options
  * Energy/Mass Vampire Options
  * Zombie slot selection
* Zombie slot unit death changes
* Welcome message
* Left info slideout (WIP, empty right now)

### Zombie slot unit death changes

Zombie player units no longer completely die and respawn from where the wreck is. This was the cause of some weirdness such as naval units not coming back till they sunk, and air units spawning on the ground. This also caused some grief to players as move/attack orders would be lost.

This has been changed so Zombie player units, on first death, show an explosion, but keep attacking/moving immediately. Vampire mass/energy and veterancy is handed out appropriately.

## Planned Features

* Mass/Energy Vampire Stats in slideout
* Zombies killed stats in sidebar
* Random Zombie assignment game mode (like phantom)
* Zombie unit health decay
* Some sort of buffs/nerfs to Zombies/Normies to make the game more dynamic
* Cheese Mode (Fractal Zombies)
  * Players should probably limit this to T1/2 ...
