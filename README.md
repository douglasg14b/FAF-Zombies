# FAF Zombies

Zombies mod for Forged Alliance Forever!

## What is this?

An enhanced version of the old Zombies mod created by Zarechaun. 

### Mechanics

A player slot is designated as the "Zombie". Any units that die in game respawn as zombies for this player. Any units that player owns, when killed, also spawn in as zombies (meaning their units need to be killed twice).

## What's Different?

* Lobby Options
  * Energy/Mass Vampire Options
  * Zombie slot selection
  * Zombie movement speed selection
  * Zombie unit decay selection
* Zombie slot unit death changes
  * Ctrl+K units no longer become zombies
* Welcome message
* Left info slideout (WIP, empty right now)

### Zombie slot unit death changes

Zombie player units no longer completely die and respawn from where the wreck is. This was the cause of some weirdness such as naval units not coming back till they sunk, and air units spawning on the ground. This also caused some grief to players as move/attack orders would be lost.

This has been changed so Zombie player units, on first death, show an explosion, but keep attacking/moving immediately. Vampire mass/energy and veterancy is handed out appropriately.

This also means that fotresses don't fall twice, and chickens don't produce two lightning storms.

## Planned Features

* Mass/Energy Vampire Stats in slideout
* Zombies killed stats in sidebar
* **Balance**
  * Zombie player only Vampire option
  * Prevent some experimentals owned by the Zombie player from respawning after death (other players experimentals still become zombies)?
  * Option to turn off Zombie players zombies? Meaning the Zombie players units are already zombies, so they don't respawn fter death.
* Random Zombie assignment game mode (like phantom)
* ~Zombie unit health decay~
* Some sort of buffs/nerfs to Zombies/Normies to make the game more dynamic
  * ~Zombie Speed~
* Cheese Mode (Fractal Zombies)
  * Experimentals should split into 1/2 mass equivilant T3 units of their kind
    * CZAR -> Restorers
    * Megolith -> 2x monkeylords
    * Fatboy -> Demolishers
    * ....etc
